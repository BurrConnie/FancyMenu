## About

FancyMenu is a forge-based minecraft mod to customize ingame menus in many ways.

A special thing about FancyMenu is, that its not limited to the basic minecraft menus like the options or inventory menu.<br>
With FancyMenu, its possible to customize nearly every default-looking menu in the game. Even menus from other mods.

Some of its key features are:<br>
- Hiding, moving, resizing and renaming buttons<br>
- Adding lines of text to menu screens and format them<br>
- Animating the background of menus<br>
- Adding textures and animations to menus<br>

## The FancyMenu Animation Engine

The animation engine used by FancyMenu can render smooth looking animations, even if they have a high resolution!

Making your own animations is super easy and can be done by everyone.

### Animation Intros

Animations can have intros, which will be played before the main animation starts.<br>
These will only be played once, even if the animation is in loop mode.

### Transparent Animations

It is possible to render frames with transparent backgrounds, which can be very useful when it comes to rendering animations as menu decoration.
